Managing Remotes / Adding a remote
Adding a remote

To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

    A remote name, for example, origin
    A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git

For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

git remote -v
# Verify new remote
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

Managing Remotes / Renaming a remote
Renaming a remote

Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote.

The git remote rename command takes two arguments:

    An existing remote name, for example, origin
    A new name for the remote, for example, destination

Example

The examples below assume you're cloning using HTTPS, which is recommended.

git remote -v
# View existing remotes
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

git remote rename origin destination
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'destination'

git remote -v
# Verify remote's new name
# destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)


Managing Remotes / Removing a remote
Removing a remote

Use the git remote rm command to remove a remote URL from your repository.

The git remote rm command takes one argument:

    A remote name, for example, destination

Example

The examples below assume you're cloning using HTTPS, which is recommended.

git remote -v
# View current remotes
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)
# destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# destination  https://github.com/FORKER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

git remote rm destination
# Remove remote
git remote -v
# Verify it's gone
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git (push)

Note: git remote rm does not delete the remote repository from the server. It simply removes the remote and its references from your local repository.
