Putting your existing work on GitHub can let you share and collaborate in lots of great ways.

Tip: If you're most comfortable with a point-and-click user interface, try adding your project with one of our desktop applications. For more information, see "How do I add repositories?" for Mac, and "Adding repositories with GitHub for Windows" for Windows.

    Passwords
    SSH keys
    AWS access keys
    API keys
    Credit card numbers
    PIN numbers

For more information, see "Remove sensitive data."

    Create New Repository drop-down Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

    Open Terminal (for Mac users) or the command prompt (for Windows and Linux users).

    Change the current working directory to your local project.

    Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

    git init

    Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

    git add .
    # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

    Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

    git commit -m 'First commit'
    # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

    Copy remote repository URL fieldAt the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click 

to copy the remote repository URL.

In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.

git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
